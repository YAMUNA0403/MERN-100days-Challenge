📦 <div> Element

Today I learned about the <div> element, which is a block-level container used to group multiple HTML elements together. It helps structure web pages and is commonly used with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity.

✅ Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .box {
      border: 2px solid blue;
      padding: 10px;
      width: 200px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Hello World</h3>
  <p>This content is inside a div.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

📌 Explanation

<div> groups the heading and paragraph

CSS styles are applied using a class

Helps organize layout and design
